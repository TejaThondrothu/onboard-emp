# Security Implementation Guide

## Critical Security Fixes Applied

### 1. Authentication & Password Security
**Issue Fixed:** Plain text password comparison
- **Before:** `const isPasswordValid = (password === user.password);`
- **After:** `const isPasswordValid = await bcrypt.compare(password, user.password);`
- **Impact:** Passwords are now properly hashed with bcrypt (12 rounds)

### 2. Database Migration
**Issue Fixed:** Using MongoDB instead of Supabase
- **Before:** Mongoose with MongoDB
- **After:** Supabase PostgreSQL with Row Level Security
- **Impact:**
  - Built-in security with RLS
  - Better performance and scalability
  - Automatic backups and replication

### 3. Input Validation
**Issue Fixed:** No input validation on API endpoints
- **Added:** express-validator middleware
- **Coverage:** All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Protection:** SQL injection, XSS, malformed data

### 4. Rate Limiting
**Issue Fixed:** No protection against brute force attacks
- **Global Limit:** 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- **Login Limit:** 5 attempts per 15 minutes per IP
- **Impact:** Prevents brute force and DoS attacks

### 5. Security Headers
**Issue Fixed:** Missing security headers
- **Added:** Helmet middleware
- **Headers Configured:**
  - Content-Security-Policy
  - X-Frame-Options: DENY
  - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
  - Strict-Transport-Security
  - Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy

### 6. CORS Configuration
**Issue Fixed:** Open CORS policy (allowing all origins)
- **Before:** `app.use(cors());`
- **After:** Origin whitelist with proper configuration
- **Impact:** Only allowed origins can access the API

### 7. JWT Token Security
**Improvements:**
- Token expiration: 8 hours
- Secure secret key requirement (min 32 chars)
- Token verification on all protected routes
- User status validation on each request

### 8. Error Handling
**Issue Fixed:** Error messages leak sensitive information
- **Added:** Global error handler
- **Production Mode:** Generic error messages
- **Development Mode:** Detailed errors for debugging
- **Impact:** No sensitive data exposed to clients

### 9. Row Level Security (RLS)
**Database Security:**
- All tables have RLS enabled
- Users can only access their own data
- Admins have elevated permissions
- Service role used for backend operations
- No direct user access to sensitive operations

## Security Best Practices Implemented

### Password Policy
- Minimum 6 characters (configurable)
- Bcrypt hashing with 12 rounds
- Automatic password generation for new users (12 chars)
- No password storage in logs or error messages

### Token Management
- Tokens expire after 8 hours
- Bearer token format required
- Tokens validated on every protected request
- User status checked on each authentication

### Database Security
- Parameterized queries (Supabase client)
- No raw SQL execution from user input
- Foreign key constraints
- Automatic timestamp management
- Soft delete capability

### API Security
- Request size limits (10MB)
- Content-Type validation
- CORS origin validation
- Rate limiting per endpoint
- Health check endpoint for monitoring

### Code Security
- No secrets in code
- Environment variables for configuration
- Async error handling
- Graceful shutdown on errors
- Unhandled rejection catching

## Required Environment Variables

### Critical (Must Change)
```env
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secure-jwt-secret-key-min-32-chars-CHANGE-THIS
```

### Database (Supabase)
```env
SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
```

### Optional Services
```env
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-api-key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-api-secret
RESEND_API_KEY=your-resend-api-key
```

## Production Security Checklist

### Before Deployment
- [ ] Change JWT_SECRET to a strong random value (min 32 chars)
- [ ] Verify all environment variables are set
- [ ] Set NODE_ENV=production
- [ ] Configure production Supabase instance
- [ ] Review and test all RLS policies
- [ ] Configure proper CORS origins
- [ ] Enable HTTPS/TLS
- [ ] Set up SSL certificates
- [ ] Configure firewall rules
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting

### After Deployment
- [ ] Test all authentication flows
- [ ] Verify rate limiting is working
- [ ] Check security headers are present
- [ ] Test RLS policies with different users
- [ ] Monitor error logs for security issues
- [ ] Set up automated security scanning
- [ ] Configure database backups
- [ ] Document incident response procedures
- [ ] Set up log aggregation
- [ ] Enable audit logging

## Security Testing

### Manual Tests
1. **Authentication:**
   - Try login with wrong password (should fail)
   - Try accessing protected routes without token (should fail)
   - Try using expired token (should fail)
   - Try accessing inactive account (should fail)

2. **Authorization:**
   - Try admin operations as regular user (should fail)
   - Try accessing other user's data (should fail)
   - Verify RLS blocks unauthorized access

3. **Rate Limiting:**
   - Make 6+ login attempts quickly (should be blocked)
   - Make 101+ API requests in 15 minutes (should be blocked)

4. **Input Validation:**
   - Send malformed email (should be rejected)
   - Send XSS payload (should be sanitized)
   - Send very long strings (should be validated)

### Automated Tests (Recommended)
- Use tools like OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite
- Run npm audit regularly
- Set up Dependabot for dependency updates
- Use ESLint security plugins

## Monitoring & Alerting

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- Failed login attempts per IP
- Rate limit violations
- Authentication errors
- Database connection errors
- API response times
- Error rates by endpoint

### Alerts to Configure
- Multiple failed login attempts from same IP
- Unusual API usage patterns
- Database connection failures
- High error rates
- Slow response times
- Memory/CPU usage spikes

## Incident Response

### In Case of Security Incident
1. Immediately rotate JWT_SECRET
2. Revoke all active sessions
3. Review audit logs
4. Identify affected users
5. Reset passwords for affected accounts
6. Document the incident
7. Fix the vulnerability
8. Deploy the fix
9. Notify affected users (if required)
10. Update security procedures

## Regular Maintenance

### Weekly
- Review error logs for security issues
- Check for failed authentication attempts
- Monitor rate limit violations

### Monthly
- Update dependencies (npm audit fix)
- Review and update RLS policies
- Test backup restoration
- Review access logs

### Quarterly
- Security audit
- Penetration testing
- Review and update security policies
- Update documentation
